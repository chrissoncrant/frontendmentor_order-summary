# order-summary-FEM

As the title indicates, this is a project from frontendmentor.io

My estimate on how long it will take me: 2 hours. This is estimate is based on hopeful thinking I believe as I have never really timed myself. It will be an interesting experiment and will provide an initial benchmark in regards to my current level of efficiency. 

I will do my best to keep track of the time I spend on the project. 

Cheers!

## Tools used: 
- iPad, Pencil and Good Notes
- VSCode
- Digital Color Meter along with Google's RGB to HEX tool
- screen shot function for measuring widths

## Future Improvements:
- I would like to utilize CSS Variables, especially for paddings, margins, and colors.

## New Things I Learned:
- how to take a full screenshot of websites using Chrome Dev Tools

## Link to Completed Site:

## Notes:
9-28-21:
    @ 1030: Realizing the time estimate above is not taking into account getting used to how front end mentor works and getting a workflow down in regards to the project files. 
    @1050: got fonts linked, set width of body and font size, researched into how header elements' font sizes are calculated. 
    @1055: wrote out the basic html structure using iPad and pencil and Good Notes app.
    @1100: created the basic html structure ( I am using VSCode application). Filled in the basic contents (images, words). Utilizing screen shot feature in MacOS to measure out the widths with the provided jgps in the design folder. 
    @1120: began styling. Encountered an issue with the main sizes and where to apply them. I initially applied the 1440px limit to the html element, but ran into an issue where it wouldn't center horizontally due to it not having a parent container, so I created one more div between body and the main container. Also figured out a way to make it so the main-container is always in the vertical center by applying height = 100vh to the body and as well as flex and align-items to center. 
    @1140: more styling, attempting to get the spacing correct using margin and padding, added correct font colors according to the style guide.
    @1150: completed the spacing, added box shadows to the body and the main-container as well as border-radius. 
    @1200: made the width of the body more responsive by changing "width" to "max-width"
    @1205: I believe I am now finished with this project. If I had the Figma sheet I'd be able to make it more precise.
    @1230: completed the write up in this README and uploaded the repo and live site links to FrontEndMentor.io. I actually met my initial goal form time of completion.
